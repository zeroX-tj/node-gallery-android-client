Jini's Unoffical node-gallery android client

TODO:
  - Store id's returned from service in local storage linked to shared image
  - Retrieve list of images at /images, parse their status (Not submitted, Stored, Invalid) and show in list on main view
  - Create settings screen to set node-gallery server url, port, username and password

Currently no known bugs... =)
